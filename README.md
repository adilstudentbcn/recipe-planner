Description
This is a meal-planning app that helps people figure out what to cook without the stress. The main idea is that you can just tell the app what you want to eat, and it uses an AI (like the Gemini or DeepSeek API) to generate a full recipe and a grocery list for you. 


Potential Features

AI Recipe Builder: You just type in a meal you're thinking of, and the app gets the instructions and ingredients using an AI API.
Auto-Shopping List: Once a recipe is generated, the app creates a list of everything you need to buy at the store.
Step-by-Step Cooking: A clear view that walks you through the recipe steps from start to finish.
YouTube Search: I want to try and show a related YouTube video for each recipe so you can actually see how the dish is made.
Save Your Favorites: A way for users to save the recipes they liked so they can look them up again later.
Recipe Details: Showing the important stuff like ingredients, how long it takes to cook, and basic nutrition info.
